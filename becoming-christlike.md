What is the relationship between the first principles of the gospel and Christlike attributes? We teach faith, repentance, baptism — how can this change people?

To the prophet Mormon, this was not an abstract philosophical question, to be discussed and debated in the coffeehouses and salons of his day. It was very real.

Mormon’s world, the civilization and society that he knew, was collapsing around him. He seed the wickedness of the Nephites and vows never to lead them again in battle. He tells his readers that he “repented” of that oath — “and they gave me command of their armies, for they looked upon me as though I could deliver them from their afflictions.” (Mormon 5:1)

But the wise Mormon knows better, because he understands that the true affliction his people have is not the Laminates, but their own sins. He writes:

“But behold, I was without hope, for I knew the judgments of the Lord which should come upon them, for they repented not of their iniquities, but did struggle for their lives without calling on that Being who created them.” (Mormon 5:2)

Mormon understood something that we might sometimes forget — that the principles of the gospel can change hearts, and thus alter the trajectory of an individual or a nation. He writes to his son Moroni: 

“And the first fruits of repentance is baptism, and baptism comes by faith unto the fulfilling of the commandments, and the fulfilling the commandments brings remission of sins.”

Still principles, still abstract. But then he hits us.

“And the remission of sins brings meekness, and lowliness of heart, and because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of the Holy Ghost, which Comforter fillets with hope and perfect love, which love endureth by diligence unto prayer.” (Moroni 8:26)

So first comes humility. Then hope and charity, from the Holy Ghost. These are kept by diligence in prayer. And the whole thing starts with remission of sins.

“Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, that when He shall appear we shall be like him, that we may be purified even as He is pure. Amen.” (Moroni 7:48)

Brothers and sisters, I wish I had time to tell you how true this pattern has been in my own life. I don’t. But I will say that this is the pattern that brought me unto Christ. And keeps me coming back, again, and again. In His sacred name, amen.
