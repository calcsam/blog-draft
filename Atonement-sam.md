## The Physics Of Atonement, in Animated GIFs

We traditionally represent pain and emotional burdens as loads that we carry around with us. ([Mosiah 18:8](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.8), [Matthew 11:28-30](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/11.28-30?lang=eng), etc). Physically, we represent them as mass.

When we then as Christians talk about being free from our burdens, we use a variety of metaphors. We talk about giving our burdens to Christ. We talk of [laying them down](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ps/55.22) and [having them made light](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24.14?lang=eng). We speak of taking rocks out of our backpack.

### Momentum

This metaphor is powerful, but I want to explore an alternative. 

Rather than representing burdens or pain in units of mass (kg), I suggest we represent them in units of momentum, which is mass times velocity, or kg * meters / second.

In addition, rather than representing our burdens and pains as separate objects from ourself, I suggest we represent them as parts of ourself.

### Collisions

In this view, we are all objects in motion, and as we collide with each others, we transfer all of our emotions to them in some degree.

Consider these collisions:

#### Avalanche

The avalanche has the falling rock collides with other rock, gathering mass and velocity, **increasing momentum** as it rolls down the mountain.

A father suffers physical abuse as a child, and then inflicts it on his children. "visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the childrenâ€™s children, unto the third and to the fourth generation...." (Exodus 34:7)

#### Billiard split

The white cue ball collides with the other billiard ball triangle. Its momentum is transferred to the other balls. It stops.  **Overall momentum is constant.**

A boss spills coffee on his shirt, so he yells at his secretary. Then he feels better. 

#### The putting green

The putting green, through friction, gradually slows the rolling golf ball down, **decreasing overall momentum**.

A man is going through a difficult divorce. His best friend comes over on Saturday morning and they put a new finish on the deck. They don't talk about the situation at all, but by afternoon, he feels a bit better.

In different times, in different places, we find ourselves as players in each scenario.

### Comforting those in need of comfort

As we seek to "mourn with those that mourn, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort" (Mosiah 18:8) we must sail our ship through a narrow passage, avoiding shoals on either side that can wreck us.

#### Being a billiard ball

One of these rocky shores, on which our ship can wreck, is where we simply position ourselves as billiard balls in the triangle. 

We absorb the chaos of others around us simply by transferring it onto ourself, without any ability to release it. Michael Austin shares a heart-wrenching story of [doing this in a pastoral capacity](https://bycommonconsent.com/2015/05/04/daniel-my-brother-the-case-for-pastoral-training-in-the-church/), with devastating results.

#### Building a wall

At the other edge of the channel, we wreck others when we see the Atonement, the process of dissipating pain, as something like this:

Christ did not do this. He did not simply stop it in its tracks. He did not simply put upon iron walls around the pain of the world, perfectly insulating himself from it. Christ "suffer[ed] pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind" in order to "take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people."

After his infant son died, Rabbi Harold Kushner found that many people would come to him and say, well-meaning, lines like "I'm sure he's happier now." Some of us, when we see a misfortune befall a friend, immediately jump to find the cause in something they did.

Do we rationalize pain in this way simply because we desire to inoculate ourself from it? 

### A putting green, with friction

Christ created a shared space in which the pain of humanity was released. However he performed the Atonement, and however much pain he took upon himself, we must believe that He does not still carry it with him. He has access to some sort of friction that dissipates the momentum of pain.

As we figure out how to generate friction, to slow the pain of ourselves and others to a stop, *that* must be truly particpating in Christ's atonement.
