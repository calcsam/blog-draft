# The Physics Of Atonement, in Animated GIFs

We traditionally represent pain and emotional burdens as loads that we carry around with us. ([Mosiah 18:8](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.8), [Matthew 11:28-30](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/11.28-30?lang=eng), etc). Physically, we represent them as mass.

When we then as Christians talk about being free from our burdens, we use a variety of metaphors. We talk about giving our burdens to Christ. We talk of [laying them down](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ps/55.22) and [having them made light](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24.14?lang=eng). We speak of taking rocks out of our backpack.

This metaphor is powerful, but I want to explore an alternative. 

Rather than representing burdens or pain in units of mass (kg), I suggest we represent them in units of momentum, which is mass times velocity, or kg * meters / second.

In addition, rather than representing our burdens and pains as separate objects from ourself, I suggest we represent them as parts of ourself.

In this view, we are all objects in motion, and as we collide with each others, we transfer all of our emotions to them in some degree.

Consider these collisions:

The avalanche has the falling rock collides with other rock, gathering mass and velocity, **increasing momentum** as it rolls down the mountain.

##### Billiard split

The white cue ball collides with the other billiard ball triangle. Its momentum is transferred to the other balls. It stops.  **Overall momentum is constant.**

#### Golf ball

The putting green, through friction, gradually slows the rolling golf ball down, **decreasing overall momentum**.

We all find ourself as players in each scenario.

##### The Avalanche
A father suffers physical abuse as a child, and then inflicts it on his children. "visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the childrenâ€™s children, unto the third and to the fourth generation...." (Exodus 34:7)

##### The Cue Ball
A boss spills coffee on his shirt, so he yells at his secretary. Then he feels better. 

##### The Putting Green

A man is going through a difficult divorce. His best friend comes over on Saturday morning and they put a new finish on the deck. They don't talk about the situation at all, but by afternoon, he feels a bit better.

One danger is that, in our attempts to be the putting green,we position ourselves as billiard balls in the triangle. 

We absorb the chaos of others around us simply by transferring it onto ourself, without any ability to release it. Michael Austin shares a heart-wrenching story of [doing this in a pastoral capacity](https://bycommonconsent.com/2015/05/04/daniel-my-brother-the-case-for-pastoral-training-in-the-church/), with devastating results.

Another danger is that we see the Atonement as too magical, something like this:

Even Christ did not do this. He certainly took the world's pain on himself, but we must believe that he does not still carry it with him. He has access to some sort of friction that disspates momentum.


When we figure out how to generate friction, to slow the pain of ourselves and others to a stop, I have a sense *that* is truly particpating in Christ's atonement.
