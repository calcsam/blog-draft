# The Physics Of Atonement, in Animated GIFs

We traditionally represent pain and emotional burdens as loads that we carry around with us. ([Mosiah 18:8](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.8), [Matthew 11:28-30](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/11.28-30?lang=eng), etc). Physically, we represent them as mass.

When we then as Christians talk about being free from our burdens, we use a variety of metaphors. We talk about giving our burdens to Christ. We talk of [laying them down](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ps/55.22) and [having them made light](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24.14?lang=eng). We speak of taking rocks out of our backpack.

This metaphor is powerful, but I want to explore an alternative. 

Rather than representing burdens or pain in units of mass (kg), I suggest we represent them in units of momentum, which is mass times velocity, or kg * meters / second.

In addition, rather than representing our burdens and pains as separate objects from ourself, I suggest we represent them as parts of ourself.

In this view, we are all objects in motion, and as we collide with each other, we transfer all of our emotions to them in some degree, our joys as well as our sorrows, though right now I'll be strictly focusing on the pain.

Consider these collisions:

##### Avalanche

#### Velcro Wall

The avalanche has the falling rock collides with other rock, gathering mass and velocity, **increasing momentum** as it rolls down the mountain.

The curling stone collides with other stones in a low-friction environment. Momentum is transferred between the stones, but **overall momentum is constant.**

The velcro well is a high-friction environment that absorbs the impact of the jumper, **decreasing overall momentum**.

We all find ourself as players in each scenario.

##### The Avalanche
A father suffers physical abuse as a child, and then inflicts it on his children. He is like the avalanche. He continues to hold the pain, and in addition transfers it on. The overall amount of pain has increased.

##### The Curling Stone
A boss spills coffee on his shirt, so he yells at his secretary. Then he feels better. He is like the curling ball. His pain is gone, but he's transferred it elsewhere. The overall amount of pain in the system is constant.

##### The Velcro Wall

A man is going through a difficult divorce. His best friend comes over on Saturday morning and they put a new finish on the deck. They don't talk about the situation at all, but by afternoon, he feels a bit better.


##### Being the Velcro Wall

We all know that we're supposed to be the Velcro Wall. We're supposed to seek out others in pain, sit next to them, and make the pain go away. The risk is that we simply become the curling stone -- transferring others' pain onto ourselves without dissapating it. 

We need **friction**.

Certain professions have thought carefully about the art of colliding often with those in pain, without transferring the pain onto themselves. The medical professions as well as therapists stand out here.

Where do Christ and the Atonment come in?

Christ took upon himself all of our pains in the Garden of Gethsemane. He suffered immense physical pain as a result, but we must believe that he does not still carry it with him. He has access to some sort of friction that disspates momentum.

The danger, I fear, is that we see the Atonement as too magical, something like this:

rather than this:

When we figure out how to generate friction, to slow the pain of ourselves and others to a stop, I have a sense *that* is truly particpating in Christ's atonement.
